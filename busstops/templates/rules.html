<h1>Vehicle editing rules</h1>

<p>Vehicle details (type, colour etc.) are user-editable.
    If you want to get involved, great! But please follow these rules, so you don’t waste your time and others’:</p>

<ol class="rules">
	<li><p>If a vehicle is <strong>tracking on the wrong entry</strong>, please <strong>don't try to correct it.</strong> Our entries come from tracking data, and will need to be corrected by operators.</p></li>
	<li><p>Do not remove vehicles from our list using the "remove from list" feature because they havent tracked (in a while), because they are on sale (or advertised for), or just because they were in an accident.</p></li>
	<li><p>Do not change a vehicles livery because its sanded down or is "being painted", please share a picture of the painted vehicle to update it.</p></li>
	<li><p>You should supply evidence, such as a picture you've <a href="https://imgur.com/upload">uploaded to Imgur</a> or a link to your evidence. However, please dont share evidence on <strong>private facebook groups</strong> as we cant see them, provide a picture of the post instead.</p></li>
	<li><p>Do not send edits to leave messages, please contact us on our <a href="https://timesbus.org/discord">discord</a> instead.</p></li>
	<li><p>Give people the benefit of the doubt – if they have a track record of being reliable, it's OK if they haven't provided evidence. Don't undo/decline someone else's changes unless you're sure they're wrong.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<h3>Why was my edit disapproved?</h3>
	    <p>To limit chaos, some users can approve/disapprove others' contributions. (This doesn't make them special or "admins" – there's no such thing!)
	        I know some of the rules above are onerous, and they aren't written in stone, but if your edit was disapproved it probably broke one of them.</p>
	    
	    <h3>How do I add a vehicle?</h3>
	    
	    <p>Simply join our <a href="https://timesbus.org/discord">discord</a> and request in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1337054349267959898/1359292719092072598">brute add requests</a> channel, and our team will add them when they are free.</p>
